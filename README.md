# My Cypress Tasks

This repository contains Cypress end-to-end tests for the CURA Healthcare demo site using the Page Object Model (POM) pattern.

Quick start

- Install dependencies:

```powershell
npm ci
```

- Open Cypress GUI:

```powershell
npx cypress open
```

- Run the specific CURA spec headless:

```powershell
npx cypress run --spec "cypress/e2e/cura/curaAppointment.cy.js"
```

Where to find artifacts

- Merged HTML report (generated by the test run): `cypress/reports/json/curaAppointment.json_2026-02-16_10-16-50.html`
- Final copied report in the repository: `cypress/reports/curaAppointment-final.html`
- Screenshot: `cypress/screenshots/curaAppointment.cy.js/appointment-booked.png`
- Video: `cypress/videos/curaAppointment.cy.js.mp4`

Notes

- Remove or rotate the GitHub token used to push changes if it was temporary.
- If you want the report embedded as a single self-contained HTML, I can regenerate and replace `curaAppointment-final.html` with the fully inlined version.
